# Introduction


## What and Why
 
Traditionally the driving or excitation noise of spatial and temporal models is Gaussian. Take for instance an AR1 (autoregressive of order 1) process, where the increments $x_{i+1}-\rho x_i, |\rho|<1$ are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. However, real-world data may not be Gaussian in nature, and it is well known that outliers can adversely affect the inferences and predictions made from a Gaussian model. We explicate in this Bookdown how to implement a generic class of non-Gaussian models in Stan that have the same mean and covariance structure as Gaussian models, although having heavier-tails and skewed marginals, and more flexible sample path behaviors. This generic class contains many models used in applications as special cases, such as AR and random walk (RW) processes for time series, spatial MatÃ©rn models, and SAR and CAR models for areal data.


## Setup

If $\mathbf{x} \sim \text{N}(\mathbf{0}, (\mathbf{D}^T\text{diag}(\mathbf{h})\mathbf{D})^{-1})$, then it can be declared in Stan as: 
```
x ~ multi_normal_prec(rep_vector(0,N), D'*diag_matrix(1/h)*D)
```

The non-Gaussian model declaration is:
```
x ~ nig_model(D, etas, zetas, h, 1)
```

where `etas`, `zetas` are parameters that regulate the kurtosis and skewness of the model, and the last argument is an integer with value 1 if the log-determinant of $\mathbf{D}$ should be computed (if $\mathbf{D}$ depends on parameters), or 0 otherwise. 

The `nig_model` and other Stan functions can be found in `nigstan\files\functions.stan` on [github.com/rafaelcabral96](https://github.com/rafaelcabral96).

## This Bookdown

This Bookdown is organized as follows:

- Section 3: Shows how to use the different Stan functions to fit non-Gaussian models.
- Section 4: Compares the performance of the 3 implementations we propose.
- Section 5: Time-series application
