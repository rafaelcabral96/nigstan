real nig_model_lpdf in functions.stan has no comments

Github page image has mu

1. Mention in setup I am using CmdstanR
 although having heavier-tails and skewed marginals, and more flexible sample path behaviors

2. some images use mu
4. becnhmark there are end of line point and code comments are bad
add comment about the pressure example 1 day 15min

3. framework: The parameter  η⋆ controls the heaviness of the tails -> leptokurtosis
big skip in //latent field layer--------------------------
x ~ nig_model(D, etas, zetas, h, 1)
Lambda ~ nig_multi(etas, mus, h);                     //log-pdf of i.i.d. nig noise Lambda
but the latter enjoyx a 
inverse(D)*Lambda, add something before it
 to the trunk, in order remove comma

7.2.1
Note that the Gaussian log-likelihood for  rewrite this
We declare the spatial effects in the transformed parameters block ! remove this phrase alltogueter replace witha another explain this better

7.3.1 plot ICAR spatial component
remove loo figures
